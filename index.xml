      <description>Introduction  IELTS雅思考試共分聽、說、讀、寫四項科目。早上9AM起進行聽力、閱讀、寫作，約在中午完成；下午則依序進行口說考試。 不論IELTS雅思考試或IELTS for UKVI英國簽證雅思考試，均分Academic學術及General Training一般訓練兩組，兩組的聽力與口說考題是相同的，閱讀與寫作的題目則因組別而異。  General Training (unorganised) IELTS
Writing Task 2, Listening and Speaking are the same for both IELTS Academic and IELTS general.
Writing task 2 is an essay. You will be given an essay question to answer in 40 minutes by writing at least 250 words.
